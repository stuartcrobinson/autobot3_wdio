notes


TODOS:

logging needs a lot of work.  going to update it so the html reports are printed at the end of all test completion.

need to possibly throw fresh Errors when "wait" methods fail in order to get full stack trace





old notes:

wdio fresh start, going to try to use es6 in tests and wdio.conf.js file

update - failed to get es6 working in wdio.conf file.  solution: passing in global object and using it's methods as defined in es6 files.

note - tried and gave up on writing project in typescript.  it ruined the stack trace and also caused browsers to briefly open per test (even if not running that test), and i'm not sure why
