wdio fresh start, going to try to use es6 in tests and wdio.conf.js file

update - failed to get es6 working in wdio.conf file.  solution: passing in global object and using it's methods as defined in es6 files.

note - this is being cleaned up right now (wed oct 17 2018) just to prepare it to be later translated into typescript
